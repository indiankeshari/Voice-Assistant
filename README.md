# Voice-Assistant
<p><b>
  You can give commands by your mouth.
  The program will understand it and execute the task.
  Just like a mini version of Alexa.
  For example; 
  <ul>
    <li>Open NotePad</li> 
    <li>Play a hindi song on youtube</li> 
    <li>Current time</li> 
    <li>Shut Down the Computer</li>
    <li>Send "Hello" to +91911....... on WhatsApps </li>
    <li>Launch an EC2 Instance on AWS</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <br><br>
  You can explore and add as many functionality as you want.
